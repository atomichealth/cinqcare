						<h3>NOTICE OF PRIVACY PRACTICES</h3>
						<p style={{ fontWeight: "600" }}>
							This Notice describes how medical information about you may be
							used and disclosed and how you can get access to this information.
							Please review this Notice carefully.
						</p>

						<h3 style={{ fontWeight: "600" }}>I. GENERAL INFORMATION</h3>
						<p>
							This Notice describes the practices that Care at Home Medical
							Practice (“Care at Home,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) will follow with
							regard to your “protected health information” (“PHI”).
						</p>
						<p>
							PHI is a special term, defined by the Health Insurance Portability
							and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) and its regulations (the
							“Privacy Rule”). PHI means individually identifiable health
							information (including demographic information) that is created or
							received by certain health care providers, a health plan, or a
							health care clearinghouse and relates to: (i) your past, present,
							or future physical or mental health or condition; (ii) the
							delivery of health care to you; or (iii) the past, present, or
							future payment for the delivery of health care to you. For
							purposes of this Notice, PHI includes information related to our
							provision of health care services, which may include, without
							limitation, your symptoms, examination and test results,
							diagnoses, treatment, and billing and insurance records. We need
							this information to provide you with quality care and to comply
							with certain legal requirements.
						</p>
						<p>
							This Notice applies to all PHI that Care at Home maintains. Other
							parties involved in the provision of your health services, such as
							other health care providers or your insurance company, may have
							different policies or notices related to their use and disclosure
							of PHI.
						</p>
						<p>
							You may have additional rights under state law. State laws that
							provide greater privacy protection or broader privacy rights will
							continue to apply.
						</p>

							IV. YOUR RIGHTS REGARDING YOUR PHI
						</h3>
						<p style={{ fontWeight: "600" }}>Right to Inspect and Copy</p>
						<p>
							You have the right to inspect and copy your PHI. You must submit
							your request in writing to the Contact Office. If you request a
							copy of your PHI, we may charge a fee for the costs of copying,
							mailing, or other supplies associated with your request. We may
							deny your request to inspect and copy in certain very limited
							circumstances; if we deny you access to your PHI, you may request
							that the denial be reviewed.
						</p>
						<p>
							The Privacy Rule contains a few exceptions to this right. You do
							not have the right to inspect or copy, among other things,
							psychotherapy notes or materials that are compiled in anticipation
							of litigation or similar proceedings.
						</p>
						<p style={{ fontWeight: "600" }}>Right to Request an Amendment</p>
						<p>
							If you believe that the PHI we have about you is incorrect or
							incomplete, you may ask us to amend the PHI. You have the right to
							request an amendment for as long as the PHI is kept by or for Care
							at Home. Your request must be in writing and must include a reason
							or explanation that supports your request. Request forms are
							available from and must be submitted to the following address:
						</p>

						<address
							style={{
								fontSize: "clamp(1.125rem, 1vw + 1rem, 1.25rem)",
								marginBottom: "20px",
								lineHeight: "1.4",

							<br />
							564 Niagara St
							<br />
							Building #2
							<br />
							Buffalo, NY 14201
						</address>

						<p>
							If we approve your request, we will include the amendment in any
							future disclosures of the relevant PHI. If we deny your request
							for an amendment, you may file a written statement of
							disagreement, which we may rebut in writing. The denial, statement
							of disagreement, and rebuttal will be included in any future
							disclosures of the relevant PHI.
						</p>

						<p>
							We may deny your request for an amendment if it is not in writing
							or does not include a reason to support the request. In addition,
							we may deny your request if you ask us to amend PHI that: is not
							part of the PHI kept by or for Care at Home; was not created by
							us, unless the person or entity that created the information is no
							longer available to make the amendment; is not part of the
							information which you would be permitted to inspect and copy; or
							is accurate and complete. All denials will be made in writing.
						</p>

						<p style={{ fontWeight: "600" }}>
							Right to an Accounting of Disclosures
						</p>

						<p>
							You have the right to request an “accounting” of the instances in
							which we disclosed your PHI for up to six years before the date of
							your request. Certain disclosures are exempt from the accounting
							requirement.
						</p>
						<p>
							Your request must be in writing. The request must include the time
							frame that you would like us to cover. Request forms are available
							from and must be submitted to the Contact Office. In certain
							circumstances, we may charge you for the cost of providing the
							accounting. We will notify you of the cost involved and you may
							choose to withdraw or modify your request at that time before any
							costs are incurred.
						</p>
						<p style={{ fontWeight: "600" }}>Right to Request Restrictions</p>
						<p>
							You have the right to request that we restrict the PHI about you
							we use or disclose for treatment, payment, or health care
							operations. You also have the right to request that we restrict
							the PHI about you we disclose to someone who is involved in your
							care or the payment of your care, like a family member or friend.
							For example, you could ask that we not use or disclose information
							about a surgery you had. We are not required to agree to your
							request except when a restriction has been requested related to a
							disclosure to a health plan in circumstances where you (or someone
							on your behalf) have paid for services in full and where the
							purpose of the disclosure is for payment.
						</p>
						<p>
							Your request must be in writing. In your request, you must tell us
							(1) what information you want to limit; (2) whether you want to
							limit our use, disclosure, or both; and (3) to whom you want the
							limits to apply, for example, disclosure to your spouse. Request
							forms are available from and must be submitted to the Contact
							Office.
						</p>
						<p style={{ fontWeight: "600" }}>
							Right to Request Confidential Communications
						</p>
						<p>
							You have the right to request that we communicate with you about
							medical matters in a certain way or at a certain location. For
							example, you can ask that we only contact you at work or by mail.
							We will not ask you the reason for your request.
						</p>
						<p>
							Your request must be in writing. In your request, you must tell us
							how or where you wish to be contacted. Request forms are available
							from and must be submitted to the Contact Office. We will make
							reasonable efforts to accommodate your request.
						</p>
						<p style={{ fontWeight: "600" }}>
							Right to a Paper Copy of This Notice
						</p>
						<p>
							You have the right to a paper copy of this Notice. You may ask us
							to give you a copy of this Notice at any time. Even if you have
							agreed to receive this Notice electronically, you are still
							entitled to a paper copy of this Notice. You may also obtain a
							paper copy of this Notice from the Contact Office.
						</p>
						<p style={{ fontWeight: "600" }}>
							Right to Choose Someone to Act for You
						</p>
						<p>
							If you have given someone medical power of attorney or if you have
							a legal guardian, that person can exercise your rights described
							in this Notice and make choices about your PHI. We will verify
							that the person has this authority and can act for you before we
							take any action.
						</p>
						<p style={{ fontWeight: "600" }}>Complaints</p>
						<p>
							If you believe your privacy rights have been violated, you may
							file a complaint with us, or with the Secretary of the Department
							of Health and Human Services. To file a complaint with us, send a
							written complaint to the Contact Office. We will not retaliate
							against you for filing a complaint, and you will not be penalized
							in any other way for filing a complaint.
